<br><p>
Mysore, previously known as Mysuru, is the third largest and second most populated city of Karnataka. Situated right at the foot of Chamundi Hills, Mysore was once the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore. The rich cultural environment of Mysore has earned it the moniker of Cultural Capital of Karnataka.
<br>
The name Mysuru finds its roots from Mahishasura, who was a demon who had the ability to take the form of buffalo and human. It is believed that this area was ruled by the demon Mahishasura who was killed by the Goddess Chamundeshwari, whose temple is over the hills. This is how the city was named Mysore.<br>

The city has a large tourism industry, which attracts tourists from all across the World. The city is famous for the palaces, the delicious Pak and the Dashara celebration in the city. It is one of the most visited destinations in Karnataka.
